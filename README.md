# Redux Starter Kit Example - Github Issues

This project serves two purposes:

- It's a chance for me to experiment with several things I haven't used before (React hooks, TypeScript, Emotion, React-Redux hooks)
- I can hopefully turn it into the baseline for an Redux Starter Kit tutorial

Most of the code is coming from Dave Ceddia's [Github Issues Viewer example app repo](https://github.com/dceddia/github-issues-viewer).
I owe him credit for doing all the real hard work on this (API calls, components and structure, styles, etc).  I'm
mostly copy-pasting his code into this app and tweaking it until it works the way I want :)

I'm starting off by building this out as _just_ a React app.  From there, I'll convert it to Redux using RSK.

Once the RSK functionality is done, I'll try to re-create that process as a tutorial.
